# What is this project?

This is a web app built using streamlit. It is a simple exercise to create a 1 page website that: 
1) makes an api call to retrieve a list of 100 Pokemon and display them,
2) allows the names to be clicked on to provide more detail on each Pokemon,
3) has a search functiomn to search for a specific Pokemon within the list of 100
